### What it do

It basically divides the damage you deal by the value set in the script, by the default being `10000`. This can be changed to your liking via editting the `divisor` value found in `tera-short-dmg-numbers\settings.json`. The module can be set to load disabled by setting `enabled` to false as well. There's also in-game commands, wow. 

#### In-game Commands

* ***`smn`***  *`[on/off]`* turns on and off the whole module functionalities.
######
* ***`smn`*** *`divisor` `new divisor value(number)`* sets a new damage divisor.
