### **Intro**

Divides the damage you deal by a value of choice, with the default one being `1000` for pve and `1` for pvp. This is to make the target more easy to see. The module does not work below lvl 65 as damage dealt is already rather low.

#### Settings

* Edit `settings.json`:
  * `enabled` - enables/disables the module. 
  * `pvp_divisor` - pvp divisor to be used.
  * `pve_divisor` - pve divisor to be used.

#### In-game Commands

* ***`smn`***  *`[on/off]`* - turns on and off the module.
* ***`smn`*** *`pve`* *`divisor(number)`* - sets a new pve divisor.
* ***`smn`*** *`pvp`*  *`divisor(number)`* - sets a new pvp divisor.
